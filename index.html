            <p>I currently attend Cornell Engineering as a freshman, and plan to major in computer science. Since getting to school
                I have become involved in Club Frisbee and Cornell's Unmanned Air Systems Team. If I am not at my desk,
                you can find me at the gym or listening to classic rock. Also, I put my open curly braces on the same line.

                    <p>
                        This past summer, some really kind folks over at <a href = "http://www.nickelfish.com" target="_blank">
                        Nickelfish </a> invited me into their web development team. My portfolio from the internship includes sites for
                        <a href = "http://" target="_blank">Coldwell Banker</a> and <a href = "http://" target="_blank">Prudential</a>.
                        While I started with simple contributions and bug fixes, I was eventually given leading roles in my projects.

                        At CUAir, I get to broaden my versatility as an engineer while satisfying my interest in robotics and electronics.
                        I work on the electrical team, helping to develop an autonomous plane to represent my school in the Unmanned Air
                        Systems competition. My team's responsibilities include on-system computing, radio communications, and power distribution.
                        During my first semester I worked on a circuit board to control cargo-dropping motors, and a stabilizing gimbal for the
                        plane's camera.

                        This simple and addictive game was my first published android app. After spending the majority of high school
                        focused on Java, I was eager to practice some of the languages applications. Developing the app gave me a better
                        understanding of my primary language, which was helpful when learning Java frameworks such as JavaFX.
                        Working on the game also made me comfortable programming for mobile platforms.

                        Since the end of my senior year I have worked from home/school as graphic designer. I mainly design and

                        to regularly flex a creative muscle helps me keep my engineering projects fresh and unique.
